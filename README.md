# Mmm... data structures

Here are a few data structures I created for Go while
working on side projects. So far, I have opted not to
make the data structures use the empty interface, and,
instead, make the data structures use concrete types
like int and string. So far, this approach has not bothered
me too much.

godoc.org automagically parses the godocs for these data
structures, so these links will be handy:
