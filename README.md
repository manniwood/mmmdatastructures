# Mmm... data structures

## Project Status: Playground

Just some ideas I'm playing with, here. Not really for production use.
Feel free to beg/borrow/steal from here, though: it's quie permissively
licensed.

## Summary

Here are a few data structures I created for Go while
working on side projects. So far, I have opted not to
make the data structures use the empty interface, and,
instead, make the data structures use concrete types
like int and string. So far, this approach has not bothered
me too much.
